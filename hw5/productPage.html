                    <li>"Best Star Wars game I've played since Jedi Outcast/Jedi Academy.
                            Don't let the fact that it's EA stop you from playing it."</li>
                    <li>"In a few short hours with the game, I have died to rats, spiders, 
                        and a ton of other little creatures that I should be ashamed of dying to. 
                        But I keep going back and I get better. I have had perfect moments when 
                        all of my parries are timed just right and my attacks finish off the enemy 
                        without taking a scratch. This isn't Dark Souls, but it aspires to share the 
                        \same DNA DS is known for and was created decades ago in all the hard games 
                        of the NES era. It gives you a starting point and says you can do it. And 
                        that is because it is your skill that improves as well, not just your in 
                        game avatar's."</li>
                    <li>"Ok, This is a weird review. The game itself, AMAZING. I love it, if you 
                        only want melee combat, and amazing gameplay mechanics, go ahead and buy it. 
                        Although, after 10 hours, I had completed the story. To me this was disappointing 
                        that the story line was so short. I wished that they had made there more content 
                        after completion of the story, because to me it is boring running around getting 
                        collectables. So, its up to you, I wouldn't recommend it, although if you are 
                        looking forward to kicking ♥♥♥ and slicing creatures arms off, buy the game. 
                        The theme of the game is a melee combat, pve, story, singleplayer game. If 
                        those tags interest you, then this game is for you!"</li>
